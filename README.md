# Generating SBOM with Cyclonedx-npm and Identifying Vulnerabilities with Bomber

This guide outlines the process of generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using Cyclonedx-npm and identifying vulnerabilities with Bomber. SBOMs provide a comprehensive inventory of software components and their versions, essential for managing software supply chain risks.

## Steps

1. **Install Cyclonedx-npm**:
     *npm install @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm*


2. **Generate SBOM**: Generate an SBOM for the project by running the following command in the project directory where the `package.json` is located. This command will create an SBOM file in CycloneDX JSON format.
   *cyclonedx-npm --output-format JSON --output-file taskManagerSBOM.json*


3. **Install Bomber**:
   *brew tap devops-kung-fu/homebrew-tap*
   *brew install devops-kung-fu/homebrew-tap/bomber*


5. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Run the following command with the JSON file generated by the Cyclonedx-npm command to display vulnerabilities.

  *bomber scan taskManagerBOM.json > taskManager-Vulnerabilities.txt*


  Alternatively, SBOM can be generated using FOSSA and vulnerabilities can be identified with Bomber by following similar steps. Sign up for an account on FOSSA, set up the project in the FOSSA dashboard, integrate FOSSA with the project's repository (e.g., GitHub), and download the generated SBOM file. Then, run the following command in the project directory to scan the downloaded SBOM for vulnerabilities.

  *bomber scan FOSSA-CycloneDX-SBOM.json > FOSSA-Vulnerabilities.txt*


  By following these methods, we can effectively generate an SBOM using both Cyclonedx-npm and FOSSA, and then identify vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies using the Bomber CLI command.
